In order for this script to work properly, you will need a file called subnet_list.txt which will include your individual
network subnets you wish to scan. Later on I will have the app ask the user for a subnet in the single scans, but this works
well for multiple scans. The subnets should be placed like shown below.

192.168.100.1/24
192.168.200.1/16
192.168.300.1/24
